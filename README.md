Hi, I’m Miguel Duque, and I’m excited to start a new chapter in cybersecurity. I’ve always been passionate about helping people, and with technology becoming such a huge part of our lives, I believe it’s more important than ever for individuals and organizations to protect themselves from scams, threats, and data theft.
I thrive in teamwork, love solving problems, and pick up new skills quickly. I enjoy collaborating with others to tackle challenges and find smart solutions, and I’m eager to grow in this field so I can make a real difference in keeping people safe online.
